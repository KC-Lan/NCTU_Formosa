NCTU_Formosa2017
---------
This is a software code programmed by NCTU_Formosa, 2017.This year ,we build a predict model of 
peptide function. We introduce our model to the antifungal peptide prediction and get 
a good performance for antifungal peptide prediction. In the end ,we also conduct wet lab 
experiment to validate our model.Finally we proof that our model works well and discover 
some new antifungal peptides that have never been found before.Besides , we also built an antifungal
 database that links up the relationship of hosts, pathogens and antifungal peptides all together, provide user who aims to
solve plant diseases and to search all available information at once.

Our database website is available at [Parabase](http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/~nctu_formosa/Parabase/)

#### To learn more about our project , you can check our iGEM wiki.

#It contains three files , they are predict model,database,and IoT. The description of files is as follows.

  1 predict model : the SCM code and the visualize code.
  
  2 database : the code we used for database website.
  
  3 IoT : the code we use for the prediction model and IoT talk system.
