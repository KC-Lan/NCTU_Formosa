NCTU_Formosa2017
---------
This is a software code about NCTU_Formosa2017.This year ,we built a predict model of 
peptide function. We introduce our model to the antifungal peptide prediction and get 
a good performance for antifungal peptide prediction. At the end ,we also conduct wet lab 
experiment to validate our model.Finally we proof that our model works well and discover 
some new antifungal peptide that never been found before.Besides , we also built an antifungal
 database that link host , pathogens and antifungal peptide all together, provide user who aims to
solve plant disease to search all available information at once.

Our database website is available at [Parabase](http://web.it.nctu.edu.tw/~nctu_formosa/Parabase/)

#It contain three files , they are predict model,database,and IoT. The description of files is as follows.

  1 predict model : the SCM code and the visualize code.
  
  2 database : the code we use for database website.
  
  3 IoT : the code we use for the prediction model and IoT talk system.
